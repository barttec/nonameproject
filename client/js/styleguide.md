# Project goal
## Summary:
### Get a multiplayer game out there that can be played by anyone and that is driven by FUN MOVEMENT MECHANICS, movement is all we go for. If you don't move you loose, that's the whole premise. We then gamify it with cool sounds and nice effects and stuff like that. We want this to be something played with a friend for around 30 minutes
